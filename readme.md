# Guru HTML linter

Guru is a javascript to lint html in the browser using css selectors based on an [article by bitsofco.de](https://bitsofco.de/linting-html-using-css/). This way, you're not dependent on browserspecific plugins or other third-party tools to verify your website.

## Setup

To add guru to your website just add the following line to your html:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/path_to/guru.js"></script>

## Todo's

This is only the beginning...

- Add a way to disable/enable the linter without removing the script-tag
- Disable/enable specific rules
- Add more rules to check
- Implement a 404 scanner
